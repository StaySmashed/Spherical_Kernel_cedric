config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Intellidemand aka Intelligent Ondemand from Faux is yet another governor that's based on ondemand. Unlike 		  what some users believe, this governor is not the replacement for OC Daemon (Having different governors for 		  sleep and awake). The original intellidemand behaves differently according to GPU usage. When GPU is really 		  busy (gaming, maps, benchmarking, etc) intellidemand behaves like ondemand. When GPU is 'idling' (or 		  moderately busy), intellidemand limits max frequency to a step depending on frequencies available in your 		  device/kernel for saving battery. This is called browsing mode. We can see some 'traces' of interactive 		  governor here. Frequency scale-up decision is made based on idling time of CPU. Lower idling time (<20%) 		  causes CPU to scale-up from current frequency. Frequency scale-down happens at steps=5% of max frequency. 		  (This parameter is tunable only in conservative, among the popular governors)
	  To sum up, this is an intelligent ondemand that enters browsing mode to limit max frequency when GPU is 		  idling, and (exits browsing mode) behaves like ondemand when GPU is busy; to deliver performance for gaming 	 	  and such. Intellidemand does not jump to highest frequency when screen is off.

	  This new find from Tegrak is based on Interactive & Smartass governors and is one of the favorites.
	  Old Version: When workload is greater than or equal to 60%, the governor scales up CPU to next higher step. 		  When workload is less than 60%, governor scales down CPU to next lower step. When screen is off, frequency is 	  locked to global scaling minimum frequency.
	  New Version: Three more user configurable parameters: inc_cpu_load, pump_up_step, pump_down_step. Unlike 		  older version, this one gives more control for the user. We can set the threshold at which governor decides 		  to scale up/down. We can also set number of frequency steps to be skipped while polling up and down.
	  When workload greater than or equal to inc_cpu_load, governor scales CPU pump_up_step steps up. When workload 	  is less than inc_cpu_load, governor scales CPU down pump_down_step steps down.

	help
	  Version 2 of the original smartass governor from Erasmux. Another favorite for many a people. The governor 		  aim for an "ideal frequency", and ramp up more aggressively towards this freq and less aggressive after. It 		  uses different ideal frequencies for screen on and screen off, namely awake_ideal_freq and sleep_ideal_freq. 		  This governor scales down CPU very fast (to hit sleep_ideal_freq soon) while screen is off and scales up 		  rapidly to awake_ideal_freq (500 mhz for GS2 by default) when screen is on. There's no upper limit for 		  frequency while screen is off (unlike Smartass). So the entire frequency range is available for the governor 		  to use during screen-on and screen-off state. The motto of this governor is a balance between performance and 	  battery.

	  Basically an ondemand with suspend/wake profiles. This governor is supposed to be a battery
	  friendly ondemand. When screen is off, max frequency is capped at 500 mhz. Even though
	  ondemand is the default governor in many kernel and is considered safe/stable, the support
	  for ondemand/ondemandX depends on CPU
	  capability to do fast frequency switching which are very low latency frequency transitions.
	  I have read somewhere that the performance of ondemand/ondemandx were significantly varying
	  for different i/o schedulers.  This is not true for most of the other governors. I personally
	  feel ondemand/ondemandx goes best with SIO I/O scheduler.
